        1. How is Vastu important for our living?
        <span class="transition group-open:rotate-180">▼</span>

  A famous astrologer, <span class="font-bold text-blue-600">Mr. Kapiel Raaj</span>, once said: "A person with an excellent horoscope can struggle while living in a property with <span class="font-bold text-red-500">bad Vastu</span>, whereas a person with one of the worst horoscopes can live like a king or queen if they choose a property with <span class="font-bold text-green-600">perfect Vastu</span>. With proper Vastu, one can manifest their desires, have <span class="font-bold text-purple-600">good mental & physical health</span>, <span class="font-bold text-orange-500">harmonious relationships</span>, support, prosperity, name, fame, and all positive things in life."

        2. How do you find the directions of your house?
        <span class="transition group-open:rotate-180">▼</span>
      </summary>
      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-800 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed font-semibold italic">
  Traditionally, people assume directions based on the corners of the property. But in <span class="font-bold text-blue-600">99.99% of cases</span> where the property is not aligned exactly to true North, the assumed direction can be incorrect.<br><br>
  
  You may think your bedroom is in the exact <span class="font-bold text-green-600">South West</span> of your property, but when mapped with <span class="font-bold text-orange-500">Google Earth</span> (which shows True North at 0°), the assumed Southwest could actually be <span class="font-bold text-purple-600">South of Southwest</span>—an ideal direction for toilets.<br><br>
  
  The <span class="font-bold text-blue-600">ideal way</span> to detect directions is by taking our consultation or going to your property's center (for square/rectangular properties) or centroid (for irregular shapes) and pointing the compass to find a near-accurate direction.

     <p class="mt-2 text-gray-800 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed font-semibold italic">
  Correcting Vastu defects in your house is called <span class="font-bold text-blue-600">Vastu correction</span>. This may involve <span class="font-bold text-green-600">rearranging articles</span> in your house, <span class="font-bold text-orange-500">disposing of undesirable items</span>, or utilities. It can also include <span class="font-bold text-purple-600">sticking tapes</span> or <span class="font-bold text-purple-600">burying thin metallic strips</span> in the directions of Vastu anomalies.

  Not really. We advocate correcting Vastu <span class="font-bold text-blue-600">without breaking anything</span>. However, toilets in <span class="font-bold text-green-600">North East</span> and <span class="font-bold text-green-600">South West</span>, and the kitchen in <span class="font-bold text-orange-500">North East</span> and <span class="font-bold text-orange-500">North West</span> may need to be shifted to nearby ideal directions.
