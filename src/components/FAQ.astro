        How is Vastu important for our living?

        A famous astrologer, Mr. Kapiel Raaj, once said, "A person with an excellent horoscope can struggle while living in a property with bad Vastu, while a person with one of the worst horoscopes can live like a king or queen if they choose to live in a property with perfect Vastu."
        With proper Vastu, one can manifest their desires, have good mental and physical health, good relationships, support, prosperity, name, fame, and all positive things in life.

        How do you find the directions of your house?

      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600">
        Traditionally, people assume the directions with respect to the corners of the property. But in 99.99% of cases where the property is not aligned exactly to the true North, the assumed direction proves to be wrong. <br><br>
        You may think your bedroom is in the exact Southwest of your property, but when mapped with Google Earth, which provides the details of the True North (which is a perfect 0 degrees in your place), the Southwest direction which you assumed could be South of Southwest, which is an ideal direction for toilets. <br><br>
        The ideal way to detect direction is by taking our consultation or going to your property's center (for square or rectangular properties) or centroid (for irregular shapes) and then pointing the compass to the desired direction to find a near-accurate direction.
